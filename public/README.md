# Adamin
A clean admin template made with Foundation.

Primarily made for my own use when making web apps but thought I would release it as most admin templates are bloated and costly.

Adamin is lightweight and designed in a way that let's you do what ever you want not what the template creator wanted you to do.

As such the are only two templates included, a login page and a dashboard page.

Adamin is made with Foundation 6 and so is very simple to add boxes and such, the main css file is not minified so feel free to customise it as much as you want.
